## Defined spawn point system
- Config: spawn-point.enabled, world, x, y, z, yaw, pitch.
- Commands: /animcore setspawn (enable + save), /animcore spawn [player].
- Join flow respects spawn point (teleports first; animation runs there).

## /animcore play (separate from /test)
- Plays animation with full flow.

## Animation Selection GUI overhaul
- Reads per-animation GUI: (icon, Displayname, Lore, ModelID).
- AutoHideLocked option to always hide locked items and remove the toggle.
- Auto-generate GUI sections for animations missing GUI: (default material/name/lore/model id).

## Improved AFK handling
- If a player has no AFK preference, AFK detection is silently ignored.

## Spawn point manager improvements
- Works with mixed numeric types (int/float/double) in config.

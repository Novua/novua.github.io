Crouch/fly-speed issue during emotes fixed (sneak cancel only when emote active).
Entities left behind â€“ no longer reproducible in latest build.
spawnAndGetAnimationId null-safety added; avoids NPEs and logs in debug.
MythicMobs imports & API calls updated for compatibility.
GUI item meta (material, name, lore, CustomModelData) reliably applied.
JoinAnimation double-registration guard to prevent duplicate event handling.
Spawn-point yaw/pitch misdetection fixed (treat config numeric types generically).
JoinTrace logging reverted to debug-mode only, keeping console clean by default.

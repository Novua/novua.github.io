Preferences now reload only when valid data is found, preventing empty database responses from wiping player settings. 
When saving to SQL, only the requesting player’s data is updated, keeping everyone else’s preferences safe and preserving nested settings for better reliability.
Animation entities are now fully linked to their players and automatically cleaned up when logging out, teleporting, or shutting down the server — no more lingering Mythic mobs.
The `/animcore set` command now respects permissions, saving only animations the player is allowed to use. 
Leave and teleport animations also follow permission rules and always remove temporary Mythic mobs after playing, ensuring a clean and consistent experience.
Better Error catching and handling

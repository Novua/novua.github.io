A new shared permission system now ensures that animations, the GUI, and commands check for all required permissions, allowing for multi-permission-protected features across the plugin.

Startup has been restructured into modular bootstrap components that handle configuration defaults, resource setup, database initialization, listener and command registration, and player preference loading. This includes a reusable player-preference service and an improved join listener for smoother initialization.

Player visibility and freezing are now managed by dedicated services with built-in debug logging, giving animations more consistent and reliable control over player states.
